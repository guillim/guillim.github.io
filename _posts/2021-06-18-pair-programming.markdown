Today, we are going to create a list of tools for pair programming. Why ? Because amazing tools exist, and make you more efficient. I will start with the one I know of. But please, add your favorites one in the comments.

# Upterm
### Why do i need
Instead of video-sharing your screen for only terminal commands, use Upterm.

### What is it
Basically a tool allowing your coworker to see your terminal, in their own terminal through ssh. It's a feature that can work well with Tmux.

### Advantages
* works with low wifi (video is the worst, and therefore, saves the planet)
* fast to setup (1min) and easy to understand
* free
