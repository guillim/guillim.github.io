This is a short brief to lead a Product roadmap


# Why a Product Roadmap ?

To answer the question: What do we do next... What are the next developments ?  
It helps the _product manager_ to mix _short-term_ needs & _long-term_ vision  

1. Make sure product dev are **aligned with company vision** #planning
2. **Everyone agrees** on the next product devs #communication

### Product Roadmap VS Project management
A Product roadmap has a higher point of view compared to the Project management. They have different goals. PM schedules small tasks, assign ressources in the day to day life. PR sees further away. In terms of timeline: we are about days for the PM VS months for the PR. However, the same tools can be used for the two: Github project, Jira, Trello...


Difference:

# 1. Define your Roadmap

#### Product Vision
First, you need your **product vision**: what is our final goal ?

The vision is composed of  
* the target
* the issue
* the solution
* the advantages

A precision:  
For startups, the **product vision** and the **company vision** are the same. But bigger companies are different. AirBnb for instance has 2 product visions: one for _Places_ and one for _Experiences_.

Examples:  
"**github.com** helps delivering faster and conflictless IT developments, by allowing every developper in the world to store and share and contribute to code, easily, from anywhere"  
"**PrivaTeaser** allows anyone, of any budget, to organise a private event by booking a bar easily, and quickly"

Usually, company vision comes from the Director, but it's the Product manager to define its product vision

#### Time model

You can choose between two models, but remember: no precise deadlines... Roadmap has to remain blurry! It will help you to provide a timeline-ish at date of now.

| Trimestrial = 👍 for giving timeline to your team, intern visibility  | 👍  for reporting to client + Flexible |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| in 3 months -> you can be sure of what will be delivered  | Short term |
| in 3 trimesters -> begins to be very blurry  | Middle term  |
| in 3 years -> the vision, and only the vision  | Long term|

It will define the average length of each step: how long do you focus on a problem before tackling the next one. In the example bellow, we chose the Trimestrial time model (Quarters):

![result2](/assets/img/roadmap/2.png)  


Note: the **time model defines how often you re-define your Product Roadmap**. For instance, at the begining of Q1, you define the PR and inside Q2 you put _"increase conversion rate"_. At the end of Q1, you re-define totally the PR. It means that when switching from Q1 to Q2, you can postpone _"increase conversion rate"_ for Q2 again, because some more important objectives are urging for the next 3 months, and _"increase conversion rate"_ can wait for 3 more months.

#### Effort zone

This is what you put in your Roadmap, inside each _step_ (ex: Q1) defined by your time model. It is a **bunch of features (still undefined) in order to fulfill one goal**.

There are three sources of input to listen to:
1. colleague need
1. user need
1. data

Two rules for an Effort Zone:    
**blurry** (not too precise) & **goal orientated**. Let's say your colleague ask for a _new landing page_. Better to change it for _increasing conversion rate_. This way, the _new landing page_ effort zone can be changed into _increase SIGN IN btn size_, _make form simpler_, and _change SIGN IN btn color to red_. --> FLEXIBILITY

# 2. Get inputs

Inputs can be of two types:  
1. Solution (~task _ex: re-design landing page_)
1. Problem (~goal, can have MANY solutions _ex: increase converion rate_)

EVERYTHING goes into the **Backlog**

#### 1. internal (colleague)

They come with a **Problem**, great --> find with them solutions  

They come with a **Solution**, mmmm --> find the Problem, then find the best Solutions with them.
Tips for that:  
_Why do you need this feature ?_  
_How do you do today ?_  
_When was last time you had this issue ?_  
_How much does the actual solution cost - time - money - energy ?_

#### 2. internal (data)

Will be the final call in case of uncertaincy, on **where there is the main current problem**. Main framework used: the conversion funnel  
![result3](/assets/img/roadmap/3.png)  

Second framework to identify Effort Zone: Feature Audit -> understand the typical user experience
![result4](/assets/img/roadmap/4.png)  

#### 1. external (user)

Main sources: the complaints, customer service, social networks, clients emails, app rating...
Again, identify the **Problem** (If Solution --> find the Problem)  

Methods:

1. user meeting (long): ☎️ / ✉️

1. jobs-to-be-done (quick 👍):  
Re-write the action the user complains about -> find solutions  
_What result the user wants_  
_What personal interest the user has to do this_  
_What interest for others the user has to do this_  

#### 2. external (competition)

Browse the web, talk to people... and know your competitors main features


#### Backlog

Needs to be **organised** => Group by Effort Zone (solutions sharing the same problem)  
Tool suggested for the BackLog: google sheet, Excel ...  
Tool suggested for grouping: post-it ...

![result6](/assets/img/roadmap/6.png)  

Note: if one Effort Zone takes too much space => create its ownn backlog

# 3. Select your Effort Zone: OKR

The idea is that it's easier to achieve and measure steps (key results) towards the main objective.  

**Objectives** = what you want  _ex: Reach critic mass of user_  
**Key Results** = How do you get there  _ex: reduce churn_,  _make adds_,  _increase conversion rate_  

In general, there are global 3 to 5 OKR for the company. **CLEAR and ACHIEVABLE**  
In each OKR there's 3 to 5 Key results  

They come from Directors.  

##### Product OKR
Look into company OKR's and find the one on which your produt has more impact. Validate with Directors.  


##### Link between your Product OKR into Effort Zone
Your Key Result will be sort of a measurable big task.  
Your Effort zone (from the Backlog) will help achieving your Key Result or not. When filling the Roadmap, you will use your backlog in order to choose what action to do in odrer to achieve your Key result.


# 4. Select your Priority Feature: Score

Among your Effort Zone, you need to prioritize the features. The idea is to rank **from 0 to 10**, each feature according to 4 criterias, and make it a Score (~ROI) according to this formula:  
![result5](/assets/img/roadmap/5.png)  

ex: _twitter through inscription_  
User impact: **3** (few users might use twitter - but reduce time for inscription)  
User intern: **0** (no impact on marketing, no internal use)  
User business: **1** (few users --> few additionnal revenue)  
Cost: **3** (not a big task, but probably a few days)  
**SCORE** = (3 + 0 + 1) / 3 = **1.3**  
==> High chance we won't developp this!

Note: there are other methods, but less recommended. For instance, you can directly give a score from 0 to 10, without making 4 sub-categroy-score.

# 4. PR - Redaction

Now you have:
1. a grouped + priority sorted BackLog
1. Your product OKRs  

you can do it.  

#### Draft
For you draft, copy your main OKRs on a text document. It basically means that your PR will have for barebone the main product OKRs.

#### Go through your BackLog
Starting from the highest Scores, read every Idea. Ask yourself _"Will this idea help my main objectives ?"_
1. Yes -> copy it in your draft, under the corresponding objective
1. No -> Skip it for now

#### Step back
Redesign the Effort Zone if necessary  
Try to see the two main Effort Zone stepping forward.  
Clean it

#### FeedBack from you Directors
You need to share this PR draft with you Directors. Don't loose time: simple email, no pictures, no time lost. You need fast feedback, about the core.

#### Clean presentation

Two methods: Trello Like VS PowerPoint Like. I choose this [free PPT option](https://framaslides.org/app#) because more people understand how it works.

1. Slide 1 -> OKRs  
Sum up the OKRs your team will tackle during the first period (Q1 if trimestrial time model)
![result7](/assets/img/roadmap/7.png)  

1. Slide 2 -> Effort Zone for next period  
Show the spcific plan for the next period, with tasks to be done from the backlog  
![result8](/assets/img/roadmap/8.png)  

1. Slide 3 -> Effort Zones for the year  
Should reflect the main Effort Zones from your backlog. Don't forget to remind everyone what is our product vision!  
![result9](/assets/img/roadmap/9.png)  

# 5. PR - Presentation:
At least once a month. Transparency is the key to get your team with you. And don't forget to show what has been done!
