This is a short guide to create a Product roadmap, starting from the vision and ending into concrete objectives using the OKR method.

# Mission, vision & objectives
These words all mean something different when you talk to people. Just to be clear, here is what I mean when I use them.
- Mission : What your product currently does, how you define yourself right now.
- Product Vision : What your product will do in 3 years, your long-term dream for it.
- Objectives : in X months (3 months, 6 months...) from now, what are the steps you take towards your  vision. Business oriented.  

Here is how these 3 concepts get along in the timeframe. Actions and Key results will be explained later

# What is a Product Roadmap ?

The product roadmap is a tool to answer this question: _What dev do we work on next?_
- It helps the _product manager_ to mix **_short-term_ devs & _long-term_ vision**
- It communicates on the next product devs so that **everyone agrees**

Imagine you split the next three years in small packages called quarters (because they are groups of 3 months). Quarters would go from Q1 to Q12. In each quarter, you list some objectives. The roadmap is just all the quarters. (the schema below only goes to Q4, but you can picture in your mind from Q5 to Q12 :) )

_Your roadmap should be a high-level view of what problems your product should solve. It should not be about developing solutions or defining what your product will look like_

# Product Roadmap characteristics

There are three topics to tackle:
- vision
- time model
- objectives

### Product Vision
We have talked a bit earlier about it. It's here to answer the question: What is our final goal, in 3 years ? It's composed of the **target**, the **issue**, the **solution**, the **advantages of our product**.

For startups, the **product vision** and the **company vision** are the same. But bigger companies are different. AirBnb for instance has 2 product visions: one for _Places_ and one for _Experiences_. Usually, the company vision comes from the Director, but it's up to the Product manager to define its product vision

Examples:  
- "github.com helps delivering faster and conflictless IT developments, by allowing every developer in the world to store and share and contribute to code, easily, from anywhere"  
- "PrivaTeaser allows anyone, of any budget, to organize a private event by booking a bar easily, and quickly"

### Time model

You can choose between the two models below: by _quarters_ or the _terms_. Remember though, no precise deadlines: the Roadmap has to remain blurry! It will help you to provide a timeline-ish at date of now.

| 👍 gives timeline to your team  | 👍  for reporting to client + Flexible |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| in 3 months (Q1) -> you can be sure of what will be delivered  | Short term |
| in 3 trimesters (Q3) -> begins to be very blurry  | Middle term  |
| in 3 years (Q12) -> the vision, and only the vision  | Long term|

It will define the average length of each step: how long do you focus on a problem before tackling the next one.

The **time model defines how often you re-define your Product Roadmap**. For instance, at the beginning you put inside Q2 _"increase conversion rate"_. At the end of Q1, you re-define totally the PR. You may postpone _"increase conversion rate"_ for the new Q2 again, because some more important objectives are urging for Q1.

### Objectives

This is what you put in your Roadmap, inside each quarter (or term) defined by your time model. It is a **bunch of features, inputs, tasks (still undefined) in order to fulfill one business goal**.

![result4](/assets/img/roadmap/12.png)  

#### The OKR method

Go in a direction (Business objectives) to reach this specific destination (Key results) by an improvement to this metrics (KPIs)

- **Objectives** = what you want  _ex: Reach critic mass of user_. **Not precise, business goal orientated**  
- **Key Results** = How do you get there  _ex: increase conversion rate by 20% in 3 months (last month it decreased by 5% and now is 57%)_  => **measurable**! Each Objective can have up to 3 key results. More on how to wirte a good Key result [here](https://critter.blog/2021/01/13/audience-friendly-goals/) (don't forget to add the context = current value + current trend)  
- **Actions** = What to do  _ex: redesign funnel buttons_  

_The premise of the OKR (objectives and key results) framework is that objectives are specific qualitative goals, and key results are quantitative measures of progress toward achieving those objectives._

Classic objectives:
- Support the product’s core value
- Create barriers to competition
- Grow market share
- Fulfill more demand
- Develop new markets
- Improve recurring revenue
- Support higher prices
- Improve lifetime value
- Lower costs
- Leverage existing assets

# The Backlog

The backlog will gather every idea to improve your product.

## Get inputs

Listen to every inputs, and store them into your product backlog. Inputs will be of two types:  
- Solution ~task (_ex: re-design landing page_)  

  What to do:  
 First, find the Problem, then find the best Solutions (they will usually be different than the first solution that was brought to you). It will be your **action** to achieve your objective.
- Problem ~goal (_ex: increase conversion rate_). can have MANY solutions.

  What to do:  
  Transform the problem into solution(s).

Inputs come from:
- Colleagues
- Data  (ex: conversion funnel framework to know where to focus on)  
- External users (Complaints, customer service, social networks, clients emails, app rating, user call...)  
- Competitors (Browse the web, talk to people... know your competitors main features)  


Example:  
Let's say your colleague ask for a _new landing page_. Better to change this input for _increasing conversion rate_. This way, the _new landing page_ can be changed into _increase SIGN IN btn size_, _make form simpler_, and _change SIGN IN btn color to red_.


_The key is to focus on understanding “why” a need or problem is worth solving (or not). The user journey map is a great way to do this because it provides context._

#### Objectives VS Trello Task
This could be summed up as Product Roadmap VS Project management.
A Product roadmap has a higher + business point of view compared to the Project management. PM schedules small tasks, assign resources in the day-to-day life. PR sees further away. In terms of timeline: we are about days for the PM VS months for the PR. However, the same tools can be used for the two: Github project, Jira, Trello...

Difference:
![result1](/assets/img/roadmap/vs.png)  

## Organize

Your backlog needs to be grouped by objectives (all the solutions sharing the same problem) and prioritized.  

### Prioritize with a Score

You need to prioritize the solutions, sometimes called the features. The idea is to rank **from 0 to 10**, each input according to 4 criteria, and make it a Score :  

`Score = (user impact + business impact + internal impact) / cost`


ex: _twitter through inscription_  
User impact: **3** (few users might use twitter - but reduce time for inscription)  
User intern: **0** (no impact on marketing, no internal use)  
User business: **1** (few users --> few additional revenue)  
Cost: **3** (not a big task, but probably a few days)  

SCORE = (3 + 0 + 1) / 3 = **1.3**  ====> quite small, there's a high chance we won't develop this!

### Group by objectives
Starting from the highest score, look at each input. Assign to it an objective. This will help you group inputs together.

Don't hesitate to rewrite objectives if they have too many inputs.

You may encounter inputs looking more like an action than a key result. It's not important, try to attach it to an objective anyway. When doing the product roadmap, you will keep in mind it's on a different level.

### Tools

- BackLog: google sheet, Excel ...  
- Grouping: post-it, miro ...

ex:

# Write the Roadmap

### Get the main objectives
For you draft, copy your main OKRs on a text document. It basically means that your PR will have for bare bone the main product OKRs.

### Go through your BackLog
Starting from the highest scores, read every Idea. Ask yourself _"Will this idea help my main objectives ?"_
1. Yes -> copy it in your draft, under the corresponding objective
1. No -> Skip it for now.

### Step back
Redesign the objectives if necessary  
Try to see the two main objectives stepping forward.  
Clean it

### FeedBacks
You need to share this draft with your collaborators. Don't lose time: simple email, no pictures, no time lost. You need fast feedback, about the core.

# Presentation

At least once a quarter. Transparency is the key to get your team with you. And don't forget to show what has been done!

Two methods:
- Trello Like
- PowerPoint Like

#### Slide 1: OKRs  
Sum up the OKRs your team will tackle during the first period (Q1)
![result7](/assets/img/roadmap/7.png)  

#### Slide 2: Actions for next period  
Specific plan for the next quarter, with tasks to be done from the backlog  
![result8](/assets/img/roadmap/8.png)  

#### Slide 3: Objectives for the year  
Should reflect the main objectives from your backlog. Don't forget to remind everyone what is our product vision!
