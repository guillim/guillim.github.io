You have an open-source project, and would like to publish it on github. You read everywhere **MIT licence** on github, but you don't know if it suits your project ? Here is a short summary of what can be done for open source projects  

##  Note

I didn't know anything about Licences. Everything I learnt is summed up here, in french [Guide for open-sourcing][ouverture]  
So this tutorial is basically a translated summary of this content.


# Licences, but on what

There are licences for Softwares (code) & content (data)


# Licences, but for what

Open-source licences will garantee 4 things:
 * freedom of **use**
 * freedom of **copy**
 * freedom of **study**
 * freedom of **modify** and **publish** modified version


# Licences, but what kind

There are two families:
  * **copyleft** which force children projects to be published under the same garantee than your project (ex: [GNU GPL][gnu])
  * **permissive** which allow children projects to be published under different licence type than your project (ex: [MIT][mit], [Apache][Apache] & [BSD][bsd])

<hr>  

# Licences, what do I do

To make it simple, if you contribute to
 * a copyleft project   -> use the same copyleft licence
 * a permissive project -> use any copyleft or permissive licence

If you create from scratch
 * Choose copyleft or permissive (copyleft will ensure children projects stay as open as yours, permissive allows anything)
