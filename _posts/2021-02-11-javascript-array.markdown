I stumbled upon a top-class summary for JS array methods. I didn't create it, all credits goes to @James Sinclair. In order to retrieve it fast, I decided to post it here. Note that the picture quality is lower than the original, so that you still see an interest in downloading [JSinclair's original pdf](https://jrsinclair.com/javascript-array-methods-cheat-sheet).
