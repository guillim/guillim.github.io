Today, a quick introduction of two amazing tools for extracting unlimited data from Linkedin. Not really a tech discovery, I agree ðŸ™‚

# Linkedin People and Company retrievers

You have many people names of many company names ? You need their Linkedin Profile urls ? Here is what you can use :

- [LinkedIn Mass Profile People Finder](https://apify.com/anchor/linkedin-people-finder)

- [LinkedIn Mass Profile Company Finder](https://apify.com/anchor/linkedin-company-url-finder)

## Why

These tools are LinkedIn profile retrievers : they generate a list of LinkedIn page URLs from a list of names. It's a simple but very useful automation if you are looking to expand a database of potential clients or competitors for market research purposes. Linkedin has millions of users and companies, and it is a great source of data for business, recruiting or growth.

Some paths you could go through :

- find someone linkedin profile and use it to show your business product
- hunt someone on linkedin to recruit him
- enrich your lead database with linkedin profiles

### Unfair advantages

These Linkedin retrievers have some big competitive advantage :

- No limits in number of pages
- Fast
- No authentification required
- API available for integration with zapier or other tools
- hidden IP with VPN like IPs

## How

It's super easy. Made for non-tech people.

1. Click on [Try for free](https://apify.com/anchor/linkedin-people-finder)
2. Enter the name you want to find on LinkedIn (if list, one per row)
3. Click on `Run`
4. When the job has finished, preview or download your list of URLs.

Results will look like that (search `John Malkovich`)

## Alternatives Pros/Cons

- If you have used tools like [phantombuster-profile-scraper](https://phantombuster.com/automations/linkedin/3112/linkedin-profile-scraper) You know how frequent you have to manually refresh the cookie. No need here. And no chance to be banned from linkedin because Linkedin won't know it's you ! Actually, to be faire, you could use both since they are complementary.
- LinkedIn People and company Finders will enable you to get way more data from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) than the official [Linkedin API](https://developer.linkedin.com/).

## Disclaimer

I built those tools, so I am _"a bit"_ biased.
