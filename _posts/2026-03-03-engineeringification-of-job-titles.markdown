Last week, I posted this on LinkedIn:

- Designers -> Design engineer
- Support -> Support engineer
- Sales -> Sales engineer

If you scroll LinkedIn long enough, this pattern is obvious: job titles are moving from `JOB` to `JOB engineer`.

Ian Vanagas calls this trend the **engineeringification of everything**. His core point is simple: tools are getting more powerful (and more complex), so the people who can actually use them effectively start to think and operate like engineers.

I agree. But I also think there is a second chapter.

# Why titles are shifting right now

This shift is not just vanity. It is mostly market reality.

When tooling gets deeper, three things happen:

1. **Execution moves closer to the role**  
   Designers can ship components, sales teams can automate workflows, support teams can instrument product feedback.
2. **The handoff model breaks**  
   Waiting for a specialist team for every task is too slow.
3. **Identity follows capability**  
   If your day-to-day work is systems, automation, and iteration, "engineer" feels more accurate than before.

The title change is basically a signal: "I do more than strategy or operations; I build with tools."

# The 5-year question nobody asks

Here is the real question:

If in 5 years every designer uses Figma Make, every salesperson uses Clay or lemlist, and every support team runs AI-assisted workflows... who is still "special" for using advanced tooling?

At that point, adding "engineer" to the title may not differentiate much anymore.

It will become like saying "computer literate" in 2026: expected, not exceptional.

# What will matter more than your title

Instead of debating labels, focus on leverage:

- **How fast do you adopt useful tools?**
- **Can you turn tools into repeatable workflows?**
- **Can you link your workflow to business outcomes?**
- **Can you keep learning while the stack changes every quarter?**

That is what stays valuable when titles normalize.

# Practical playbook for the next 12 months

If you want to stay ahead:

1. Pick one high-leverage tool in your role and master it deeply.
2. Build 2-3 real workflows that save time or create measurable output.
3. Document before/after impact (time saved, conversion uplift, response quality, etc.).
4. Share your playbook internally. Teaching compounds your advantage.
5. Use "engineer" in your title only if it reflects your actual operating model.

Because eventually, everyone will have access to the same tools. The edge is no longer access. The edge is execution.

# Final thought

Tooling is changing jobs faster than org charts can keep up.

So yes, add "Eng" to your job title if it helps you signal your profile and open recruiter conversations.

But if you really want long-term career safety, do not engineer everything from scratch.  
Adopt the right tools early, and ship outcomes consistently.
