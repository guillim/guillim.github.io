If you are a product guy, stuck between ideas of features and the tech team frustration, read this.

## What's your job as a product owner ?

There are many things to do, but let's focus on the "idea to code" part.

- You gather ideas, prioritize and groom these ideas (define, communicate, evaluate all risks...).  
  IDEAS ‚úÖ
- You come up with wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, then a prototype, and user stories for the tech team. Now it gets tricky.
  From Wireframes to User Stories : It gets blurry üî¥  
  Why ?

## Wireframes are closing doors

Wireframes are not flexible enough to allow changes. By nature, they are too detailed and lock the team into a specific solution before the team (UI designer & developers) can even think about it.

## Solution

Add one step between wireframes and user stories: the "shape". It's a rough sketch of the solution, not detailed, but gives a direction. This leaves designers room for creativity, focused on the problem to solve, not **your** solution. Compared to a simple description, the shape provides **boundaries** which help scope the work in the teimframe required.

Note : Experienced designers may be able to challenge and re-think a Wireframe, but that's more difficult than starting from scratch. Let's try to help everyone here !

## Example

- customers ask to ‚Äúadd a calendar‚Äù
  Proper calendar like Google Calendar are 6 month works at least. We have a **6 weeks** cycle.
- User research shows: read only is enough. 2 month timeframe fits all needs.

- Now, the designer has a loot of freedom to come up with a solution, and developers can start working on it. Developers can challenge the design to help respect the timeframe.
