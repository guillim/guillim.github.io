I tried **BMAD Method** for AI-driven development. I'm disappointed.

# What is BMAD?

BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI Driven Development) is a framework with specialized AI agents that guide you through planning, architecture, and implementation. It promises structured workflows from brainstorming to deployment.

# My experience

I wanted to build a simple **TODO list macOS app**. After **2 days** of prompting through BMAD workflows, I had:

- `PROJECT.md`
- `REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Multiple epic and story files

**Zero lines of actual code.**

# The problem

BMAD front-loads all the planning. You spend days with agents asking questions, creating PRDs, designing architecture, breaking work into stories. For a small project, it's overkill. By the time you're ready to code, you've lost momentum.

The methodology assumes you need enterprise-level planning for everything. I don't. I needed a TODO app, not a sprint ceremony.

# Looking for alternatives

I'm switching to **GSD (Get Shit Done)** — a lighter approach that prioritizes building over planning. Less markdown files, more code.
